<div>
<p>Life Is Something Important That Is Hard To Protect, And Also Hard to study<br>As a student i always thought of life as a game and not being serious<br> about it, but when i experience hardwork life is more harder than i thought <br>
it makes me say <i>why do i have to suffer like this</i>i also want to tell the story about my life.</p>

<h3>Im Christopher Esguerra Jr, I Wrote this message when i was 17 Years Old<br>Currently its August 21 of 2024<br>
I dont know where my room is, because we switched room again, i asked my classmates where it is <br>
but even for an hour no one replied and only seen my messages, i decided to do all things by myself<br>
i started leaving, all the group on my messenger like i dont even want to trust any of my classmates anymore<br>
the first one who seen my message didnt even reply i waited, and waited but to no avail<br>
no one answered, life is just too hard, its 10:53AM Im here in the library writing this messages<br>
im also reading books about earth, science, life, and even space, also animals, im also broke i have no money<br>
i always walk from my home to san bartolome for about 2.5Kilometers just to get here,, its also the same when im going back home <br>
i got late from school, and now i dont know my room, its my fault but yeah i was busy at home,<br>
at 7Am i went ahead and cook rice and do the dishes, and waited until the rice is cook since its not automatic<br>
at 8Am, i went ahead to pack my lunch, also checked if i have assignments which i already completed<br>
at 9Am, i went ahead to go bath until 9:20Am i go ahead to school, i reached the school at 10:20AM,<br>
im late by 20 minutes, not only that i dont know my room this is a curse i wanted to study<br>
its even Earth Life and Sciece which is one of my favourite since its about Life, i wanted to work<br>
no i wanted to make this work, i dont know if my body can handle everything, but in Grade 12 im planning to go work<br>
a real sideline, since on grade 11 its 8 hours of school not enough for me to go rest, but in grade 12 im sure its a short time<br>
i can go back home at 11am, and can work, i want to make this life works<br>
i want to help my family, but kept thinking how? just how?<br><br>
im weak, very weak, but i always pretend to be strong, act shameless, act confident,<br>
i wanted to make a perfect example for my classmates, but im not smart, not good, not handsome<br>
its just that i have my own mind, that i have my own idea and imagination<br>
i joined sining tanglaw, because my friends told me they were gonna join<br>
but yeah they didnt join, and no i was forced to join alone, i always liked dancing,<br>
im not good at it, but i tried and i will try, i want my mom to be proud of me as now shes raising us siblings alone<br>
How do i make this work i always though of it i even repeat it countless times,<br>
im not a good kid, and im not decent, i always think about myself, and now i want to think about my family,<br>
it seems that ive changed since my father left this world<br>
i became responsible in some things, but now i cant even be responsible for myself<br>
today i met a teacher, who helped me relieves all my stress and problem<br>
its 11am when i met her, and we just finished talking this 12pm, shes cheerful<br>
and good at encouraging, it helps me  get motivated, right now im waiting for my classmate<br>
to take me to our room
